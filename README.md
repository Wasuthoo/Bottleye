Smart IoT Plastic Water Bottle Sorting Machine
## Overview
This innovative project leverages the power of IoT and deep learning to create a sophisticated plastic water bottle sorting machine. Deployed on AWS EC2, it utilizes a Next.js frontend to communicate commands to a FastAPI backend, initiating the machine's operations.

## Key Features
Next.js Frontend: A user-friendly interface to control and monitor the machine's activities.

FastAPI Backend: Efficiently receives commands from the frontend and orchestrates machine actions.

Image Classification: Utilizes deep learning to capture and analyze images, determining the presence of a bottle.

Water Level Measurement: Employs an Arduino sensor to detect the water level in the bottle.

Automated Sorting Mechanism: If a bottle is detected and it's empty, a servo motor is activated to deposit the bottle for recycling.

Real-Time Monitoring: The frontend dynamically displays the number of bottles sorted, offering real-time updates.

## Deployment
Hosted on AWS EC2 for robust, scalable performance.
The backend is built with FastAPI for quick, asynchronous processing
